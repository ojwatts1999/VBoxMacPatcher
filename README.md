# VBoxMacPatcher
A simple file that runs the VBoxManage commands for you, so you don't have to.


This program executes the macOS VBoxManage commands so you don't do through the pain of modifing the commands so they work and copy and paste them into a cmd prompt.


This was created for my macOS VMDK file on my website;

The commands that this program executes are listed on my website too.


If you want more information, check that page out. (most likely you would have come from the website anyway so it mainly acts as a way to get back)
